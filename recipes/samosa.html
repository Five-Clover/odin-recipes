         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Boil potatoes until tender, then use a fork to roughly mash.A
             healthy dose of spices are fried up with fresh ginger and chilli 
             which is then tossed through along the peas. Add the mashed potato
             and gently but thoroughly mix. Lastly, mix through fresh coriander, 
             then let the filling cool completely before using.</li>

            <li> Mix the flour, Ajwain seeds and salt, then pour the ghee or oil in.
            Use your fingers to rub the ghee in until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. 
            We then add water until it is wet enough to form a dough.  </li>
            
            <li>Use a small knife to cut a circle in half. Work with one disc of dough
                 at a time. Brush disc with water along half the straight edge you just cut
                 fold one side in. Then fold the other side in, overlapping by about 1cm /
                  2/5″, to form a cone shape.  Fill with the spiced potato filling.</li>
            
            <li>Heat the oil to 160°C/320°F, then fry 3 or 4 samosas for 3 minutes, turning
                 occasionally. The pastry should be cooked but pale. Once you’ve done the first
                 fry with all the Samosas, increase the oil heat to 190°C/375°F. Then fry the 
                 Samosas in batches of 3 or 4 for around 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until golden </li>
